# :pencil: Details for Populating Portfolio

## Meta :gear:

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>

- In `/public/index.html` you will see `<meta>` properties commented out. Uncomment them and fill them out as apporiate (_optional_)

> Necessary if you plan on making your portfolio searchable in Google and optimizing for SEO.

- Similarly, fill out the `<title>` tags with your name or a title of your choice.
  </details>

## Images :camera:

### Favicon

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>
- Delete the existing favicon.ico (Note this sometimes takes a while to update on the development server)

- Replace favicon.ico in the `/public` directory with your own favicon (_optional_)

> The Favicon needs to be in a `.ico` format. If you have a `.png` you would like to use you can convert it to `.ico` with an online converter such as this one [here](https://icoconvert.com/).

</details>

### Logo

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>
- Delete `logo.png` from the assets folder

- Add a new `logo.png` file (_optional_)

> If you do not add another logo.png, you first & last name will display in the 'navbar-brand' area

</details>

### Other Images

**All other images can be found in `src/assets/images`**

> Be sure to keep the same filename and extension for the header-background, profile-pic, & logo.

- In the portfolio folder, add photos to represent your projects

> Naming your files with readable filenames is good practice for SEO.

**Recommended Sizes**

- `header-background.jpg` - A large hero image, at least 1200px wide, but no larger than 1900px.
- `profile-pic.png` - This should be a 1:1 aspect ratio. It will be reduced to 300px.
- `/portfolio` - Recommended aspect ratio of 5:3


# :art: Styling

This project uses SASS / SCSS.

- Easily update basic styling such as colors from `/src/styles/scss/_variables.scss`

- Only update the other partials if you know what you're doing

> In `src/styles/scss`, there are a number of folders and .scss files
>
> All of the files appended with `_` are imported into the `main.scss` file
>
> These get compiled into `src/styles/css/main.css` which is where the site css comes from

- In a terminal instance, run `npm run sass` to watch for changes to scss files and compile them into css
